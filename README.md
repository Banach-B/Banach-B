- 👋 Hi, I’m Bartek (@Banach-B)
- 👀 I’m interested in history, language learning, dietetics and sport, investing.    
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Basic stuff. 
I want to have good fundamentals before I go into something more advanced.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can help with.
- 📫 How to reach me: bartlomiej.banach94@gmail.com

I'm a beginner at Programming. I started learning out of curiosity and got hocked.   

# The road so far:
Courses and Tutorials:
1. Some initial YouTube tutorials about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
2. Some Udemy course that I never finnished.
3. Harvard's CS50 (it was great!)
4. The Odin Project. (curently, so far I enjoy it)
